                        <h3><strong>The Collision Shop Detroit</strong> realizes that your vehicle is your
                            second largest investment!</h3>
                        <p>
                            When it is involved in an accident you expect it to be repaired properly the first time. The
                            Collision
                            Shop Detroit refinishes, all repaired or replaced areas of your vehicle with a factory
                            package paint, this is the same paint that was used at the factory when the vehicle was
                            originally
                            manufactured. This way <span class="bold-text">The Collision Shop Detroit</span> ensures the
                            same paint color,
                            quality and texture as the original factory finish.

                        <p>
                            <strong>The Collision Shop Detroit</strong> will first sand all parts and
                            repaired areas, these parts or repaired areas are then primed, and then sanded again. These
                            areas will be sprayed with a sealer to ensure
                            color consistency of the factory package paint, these areas will again be sanded. Only then
                            can we
                            apply the factory package paint specific to your vehicle, this is the base color identified
                            by the
                            manufacturer.
                            <strong>The Collision Shop Detroit</strong> will then apply the clear coat
                            urethane that gives shine and durability to the paint. This is the only way <span
                                class="bold-text">The Collision Shop Detroit</span>
                            can ensure that the paint will last for the life of the vehicle.
