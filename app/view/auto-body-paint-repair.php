                            When it is involved in an accident you expect it to be repaired properly the first time. The
                            Collision
                            Shop Detroit refinishes, all repaired or replaced areas of your vehicle with a factory
                            package
                            paint,
                            this is the same paint that was used at the factory when the vehicle was originally
                            manufactured.
                            This
                            way The Collision Shop Detroit ensures the same paint color, quality and texture as the
                            original
                            factory
                            finish.

                            The Collision Shop Detroit will first sand all parts and repaired areas, these parts or
                            repaired
                            areas
                            are then primed, and then sanded again. These areas will be sprayed with a sealer to ensure
                            color
                            consistency of the factory package paint, these areas will again be sanded. Only then can we
                            apply
                            the
                            factory package paint specific to your vehicle, this is the base color identified by the
                            manufacturer.
                            The Collision Shop Detroit will then apply the clear coat urethane that gives shine and
                            durability
                            to
                            the paint. This is the only way The Collision Shop Detroit can ensure that the paint will
                            last for
                            the
                            life of the vehicle.
