                            At The Collision Shop Detroit we understand the importance of repairing your vehicle to
                            Pre-accident condition.
                            This includes glass replacement when a vehicle has been involved in an accident. Today's
                            modern vehicles have two types of glass: Fixed Glass, (windshield, back and 1/4 glass), and
                            Moveable Glass, (door glass and back glass on SUV's).

                            Our technicians are professionals at the replacement of all of your glass needs. The
                            windshield, when replaced properly, becomes an integral part of the vehicle, protecting the
                            people inside of the passenger compartment. We will also replace your door glass, and
                            mechanisms, if damaged in an accident.

                            Our technicians will ensure that the new glass will seal properly, to prevent water or air
                            leaks and to make sure that the mechanisms are working properly.

                            When your vehicle needs glass replacement, why trust anyone else but the professionals at
                            The Collision Shop Detroit for all your glass needs.
