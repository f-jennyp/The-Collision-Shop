                        <h3>Dealing with your Auto Insurance Company</h3>
                        <p>
                            We take the pain out of dealing with your insurance company to return your vehicle to
                            pre-accident condition. We repair thousands of vehicles each year for all of the major
                            insurance companies and know most of the insurance adjusters on a personal basis. From
                            filing of the original claim, to finalizing the estimate, we can handle every faze of your
                            insurance claim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some insurance companies may recommend you to take your vehicle to be repaired to a Direct
                            Repair Shop, (DRP), these shops will reimburse your insurance company for your referral in
                            the form of discounts or referral fees. When this happens, the insurance company is taking
                            advantage of your accident. These repair shops often treat the insurance company as if they
                            were the customer.

                            At <strong>The Collision Shop Detroit</strong> we do not participate in these programs and
                            this is why we are able to offer discounts to our customers by paying your deductible, or
                            offering a free loaner vehicle, (there are some restrictions that apply, please call one of
                            our locations for details). Do not let your insurance company tell you where to repair your
                            vehicle.
