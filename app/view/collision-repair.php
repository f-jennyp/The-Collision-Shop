                        <h3><strong>The Collision Shop Detroit</strong> specializes in repairing late model, (Newer),
                            vehicles.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Most of which are paid for by one of the major auto insurance companies. We will put your
                            vehicle back to pre-accident condition, structurally and cosmetically. Using factory
                            specification we straighten the frame or uni-body to itâ€™s pre-accident condition, parts are
                            replaced with OEM, (Original Equipment Manufacture), reconditioned, or with Aftermarket
                            Parts, (Lifetime Guarantee), depending on the customers request and budget.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We then refinish the repaired or replaced parts with a factory package paint. This is the
                            same paint that is used at the factory when the vehicle was originally built. This way we
                            can assure the same color, quality and texture as the factory finish. Each vehicle is then
                            detailed inside and out, prior to being delivered to the customer. This is how we are able
                            to offer a Lifetime Warranty on the repair of your vehicle at any one of our Metro Detroit
                            area locations.
