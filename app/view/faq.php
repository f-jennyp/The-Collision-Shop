				<h3 class="title-like">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><strong>If I have my vehicle repaired somewhere other than the dealership, will it void my
							warranty?</strong></h3>
					<p>Absolutely not! We make undetectable repairs to your vehicle and because of this we can offer a
						Lifetime Warranty at all of our repair centers. Warranty is covered by each individual location.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><strong>My insurance company recommended another repair facility to do the repairs to my
							vehicle, can I chose my own repair facility?</strong></h3>
					<p>Some insurance companies may recommend a particular repair facility for your repairs. The reason
						is, that your insurance company would receive discounts or kickbacks for your referral. By
						Michigan State Law, you have the right to chose your own repair facility. At <strong>The
							Collision Shop</strong>
						we offer these discounts to the customers in the form of deductible savings or a free loaner
						vehicle; as opposed to giving these discounts back to the insurance company.
					</p>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><strong>How does your Deductible & Free Loaner Program work?</strong></h3>
					<p>Your deductible savings is determined by the dollar amount of the repair. Historically we have
						been able to save our customer their entire deductible amount, but we will first need to look at
						the vehicle and do a free estimate to determine your exact deductible savings, or, the amount
						that can be applied towards a free loaner vehicle.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><strong>With so much damage to my vehicle, will my vehicle every be right again?</strong></h3>
					<p>We repair all vehicles to pre-accident condition, returning them to manufacturers specifications.
						The vehicle is then refinished with a factory package paint, this is the same paint that is used
						by the original manufacturer, this way we are able to assure the same color, quality and texture
						as the original paint.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><strong>My insurance company wants to Total my vehicle, but I still owe more on the vehicle than
							what they are willing to settle on my claim. What are my options?</strong></h3>
					<p>This happens when a customer is “Up Side Down” in their loan, to the value, of their vehicle. In
						this case, the customer can be paid off for the damage to the vehicle and then repurchase the
						vehicle back from their insurance company. We repair many vehicles for customers in this
						particular case, usually at a savings to the customer. Obviously each case is different. Ask one
						of our repair centers for further details, we are experts at these types of repairs.</p>
